# remapro
##React Native Test Project

Pull photos from flickr and show them in a ListView - Playing around with Facebook's React Native

To get started, clone this into a folder called 'renapro' and do the follwoing:

*   brew install node
*   brew install watchman
*   brew install flow
*   npm install -g react-native-cli
*   react-native init renapro

Remember to insert your own Flickr API key into the top of the index file, otherwise this won't work.

Then open the xcodeproj into Xcode, select a simulator and hit run.
